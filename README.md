# Swolify

## Overview

Hate working out but love yelling bingo? Swolify combines the thrill of Bingo with fitness! Users play an Exercise Bingo game, choosing exercises and difficulty levels. Swolify then generates exercises that fill up the Bingo board as they are completed, aiming for that satisfying "Bingo!"
